This is the first project that I worked on for ICS 212: Program Structure class. The task was to create this user interface where someone is able to interact with a database full of bank records. The user will be able to add, remove, and find bank records and print all the records currently in the database. It will also read from a file of bank records and write to a file at the end, allowing us to store the bank records even after the program has stopped running.

In this project, I used the knowledge I gained in lectures in C to complete the task. I applied what I knew about structs, pointers, and input/output in C and, later, C++. I also worked with multiple C files and header files, which taught me the importance of organization and Makefiles to make compiling and linking my projects more efficient.

In addition to learning more about the language of C, I also learned the process by which applications are made and, more importantly, testing. Part of the project was to create this test plan, which involved writing down a description of our test cases and the expected output. After writing and completing our program, we were to test it by going through the test plan and recording the results. If the expected output matched the results, then the program did what it was intended to do.
