The module UI Frameworks (Basics) was deemed the most painful module of the semester. However, I found that it was fun and very straightforward. When I first started learning HTML, I was just looking at examples and going through exercises. However, with the full tutorial on FreeCodeCamp, I found it enjoyable and helpful. I can understand what I was typing and why it was working. It was able to explain what each HTML tag would show.

The CSS tutorial was just as helpful as the HTML tutorial. I understood how classes and IDs were used to group and format elements in the body of the HTML. Sometimes, getting the correct formatting was simple and fast. Other times, it was tedious and frustrating. However, with Bootstrap, some of the more frustrating formats were easier to do. 

## Bootstrap Experience
With most of my experience in programming dealing with functionality and little experience with HTML and CSS, I found it both frustrating and rewarding to learn Bootstrap. HTML and CSS are very straightforward. What you write is what you get. However, with Bootstrap, most of the work is done for you. Just attach a class, and you’re done!

I think that is what is making it more difficult for me to grasp. Because I fully don’t understand what the classes are doing, I don’t know what to add or change to get the desired output. However, with more time and practice, I can confidently use Bootstrap without referencing the documentation as much.

One of the most challenging parts of the assignments and practice WODS was getting the alignment correct. For example, in the practice WOD of recreating the website for Murphy’s, I had difficulty in the main section, which was having an image be the backdrop and centering the text. Centering the text horizontally was simple. However, I did not know how to center the text vertically.

## Practice WODs and In-class WOD
After going through the assignments and practice WODs, I completed the in-class WOD within the time allotted. The part that I had trouble with was the second navigation bar. The first navigation bar was simple and was made easier with the given hints. However, couldn’t figure out how/why the content in the middle and at the end were not aligning. I later found that I had forgotten to wrap the contents of the navigation bar inside a <div> with class container.
