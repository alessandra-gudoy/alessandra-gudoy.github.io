  Not everyone is an expert in everything they do. Even some of the most revered professionals have questions. Everyone, at some point in their lives, has heard the phrase, “There are no stupid questions.” However, looking at it from the perspective of “There is Google, and probably documentation or a manual,” there are some questions that can be solved without asking. If there is a question that cannot be answered by searching it up and other means, and the only option left is to ask for help, then that question should be asked in a smart way.

  According to Eric Raymond’s <a href="http://www.catb.org/esr/faqs/smart-questions.html">How to ask questions the smart way</a>, people like to answer questions that are thought-provoking and interesting. By asking good questions, one can get good answers. According to Raymond, “People like that [people who seem to be unwilling to think or to do their own homework before asking questions] are time sinks, … We call people like this ‘losers.’” Then, how does one ask questions the smart way?

  Summarizing Eric Raymond’s essay, before asking, there should have already been attempts to answer the question. For example, by searching archives or the web, reading the manual or an FAQ, inspecting and experimenting, asking a friend, or, if applicable, reading the source code. If the question still remain unsolved, then ask a question. But, still, the question must be well thought out and written in clear, grammatically correct language. When posting a question, it should be on a forum related to the question and have a meaningful subject header. The problem should be precise and informative. For example, a description of the symptoms of the problem/bug (what is happening), the environment (where it is happening–machine, operating system, etc.), what research and diagnostic steps have been done (what has been attempted but unsuccessful), and a way to reproduce the problem if possible.
