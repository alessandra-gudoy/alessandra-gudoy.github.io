### Importance of Coding Standards
  
  Many people have different styles of writing. Some are better at short stories. Some like poetry. That can be said about programming languages, too. People write their code in their own style. However, as more and more people are learning to do their coding, there must be a standard in which everyone has more or less the same structure in their code. Because of a coding standard, it will be so much easier to read another person’s code.

  I agree that coding standards are essential. I was taught that just because a program works, it doesn’t mean it’s good code. For example, there can be ways to simplify the code or make it more efficient. Not only should it work, but it should be readable to other programmers. Is there a mistake in your code? If yes, is someone willing to go through your code? Or will they tell you no because they don’t know what your code tries to do? Therefore, according to Antra Verma’s <a href="https://www.browserstack.com/guide/coding-standards-best-practices">Coding Standards and Best Practices to Follow</a>, coding standards are important for readability, collaboration, consistency, scalability, error prevention, and maintenance.

### Previous Experience with Coding Standards
  I had very good programming mentors and peers when I first learned programming. They have ingrained in me a very orderly and organized way of programming. However, as I progressed, I lost some of those teachings. For example, I was taught to put the first letter of the type in the variable name. An integer holding the speed of a motor would be called iSpeed, and even more specific, iLeftFrontSpeed. A string will start with a lowercase ‘s,’ doubles with a lowercase ‘d,’ and so on.

  They emphasized how we wrote code because we worked as partners, and each pair contributed something to the team. They made sure that what we wrote was readable to everyone. Therefore, these practices have been with me throughout the years.

### ESLint with VSCode
  After my first week of using ESLint with VSCode, I found it useful and painful. There are some things that I like to keep things consistent, such as the spacing between operators or the curly brackets opening on the same line as the function header or keyword. By using ESLint, I can keep consistency. However, there are small things in ESLint that do not pass, such as putting a type for every variable. It is a good practice. However, there are some temporary variables where the type does not need to be explicitly declared, in my opinion.

  It is not that big of a deal when writing these small programs and working with only a few people. However, when
